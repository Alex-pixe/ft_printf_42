This is my third progect for school.  
You need to recode printf function with "cspdiuxX%" conversions!  
  
Bonus part: it should work with "0-+# " (space is also flag) flags and with precision and width of a standard printf!
  
Usage:  
run make and it will create a library with the ft_printf function.
